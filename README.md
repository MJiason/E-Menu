# :rocket: React Bootstrap Album Template

This is a work in progress to convert the [Bootstrap 4 Album Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album) to React using create-react-app and the [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) library!

## :gear: Installation

To install the application, clone or download the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## :tada: Using the Application

To use the application, you can simply use node to start the React app:

server:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see your mirror application in all its glory!
